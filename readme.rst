a web based game with db using codeigniter 3



Setup
=====

1. Install Apache and MySQL server, or use XAMPP.
2. If you use XAMPP, download the folder to `xampp/htdocs/`.
3. Run both MySQL and Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel.
4. Click on "Admin" for the MySQL server.
5. Create a new database called ``game``.
6. Import the SQL file:
   - Use ``game with scraped questions.sql`` for a full set of questions.
   - You can use ``game.sql``, but it has almost no questions and requires some code refactoring (TODO).
7. Launch the app in your browser:
   - ``http://localhost/Game/`` for the main page.
   - ``http://localhost/Game/Add`` to add new questions.
   - ``http://localhost/Game/Host`` to host a session.
8. Enjoy! (you have to)
